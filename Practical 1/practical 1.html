World Wide Web (WWW) The World Wide Web (WWW) is an interlinked web pages and multimedia content that users can access via the internet through web browsers. It was first invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, and it uses the HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol. Users use hyperlinks to browse and retrieve information. In this sense, the WWW has become the heart of the new digital world.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication in the web. It defines how messages are formatted and passed between variously located web browsers and servers. If a user inputs a website URL, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which in return sends the requested web page back. The secure version of the protocol, HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), encodes the communication for better safety and protection of data.

Web Designing Problems Web designing is the creation of websites, which are to be visually beautiful, user-friendly, and usable. However, there are so many problems in the process like: Responsive Design – The design and functionality on all devices must be good-be it mobile, tablet, or desktop. Browser Compatibility – Testing whether the website works well with different web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Page Loading Speed – Optimizing the images, codes, and contents for faster page loading. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) – structuring the content and metadata in such a way that search engines are more likely to index it. User Experience (UX) – developing intuitive navigation and layout structures for a smooth user experience. Security Issues – preventing cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, etc. that can steal and display user data
